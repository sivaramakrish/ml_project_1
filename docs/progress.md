```python
# Error 1: 
- File "<__array_function__ internals>", line 200, in result_type
ValueError: at least one array or dtype is required

The error you're encountering occurs when the fit_transform method in SimpleImputer is trying to process empty or incorrectly formatted data. Specifically, the message ValueError: at least one array or dtype is required indicates that the input data (data[categorical_cols] in this case) is either empty or contains a data type that isn't expected.

# To resolve this issue:
**    Check for empty columns: Itâ€™s possible that some columns in the dataset may be entirely empty. You can check for any empty columns and remove or fill them before passing the data to the SimpleImputer.

    Modify the handle_missing_data function to ensure that no empty columns are passed:**
